Thousands of Icelanders marked the 90th anniversary of sovereignty from Denmark Monday by demanding the government resign over the country 's economic crisis.

Pakistani police reported more deaths Saturday from poisoned bootleg liquor in the port city of Karachi , raising the death toll to at least 40. Several people are still being treated at a local hospital after consuming the toxic batch of liquor late Thursday. Liquor is banned for Muslims in Pakistan , although a few shops are allowed to sell alcohol to non-Muslims. But some Muslims drink alcohol , resorting to black-market supplies smuggled from abroad or homemade liquor that is sometimes tainted. Police say they have arrested several men in a series of raids for illegally preparing and selling the homemade alcohol. In October of last year , at least 12 people died after drinking contaminated liquor in the eastern city of Multan. A former U.S. Senate majority leader says he never agreed to let the Bush administration eavesdrop , without court approval , on phone calls that cross U.S. borders. Democrat Tom Daschle contradicts President Bush , who says Congress granted him the authority in legislation authorizing the use of force against al-Qaida after the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks. Hundreds of marchers tried to storm central bank headquarters in Reykjavik. In an opinion piece in the Washington Post Friday , Mr. Daschle says lawmakers granted the president extra powers to pursue al Qaida , but specifically turned down a White House request to use those powers inside the United States. President Bush last week confirmed he secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop in the United States. He called it a vital tool for national security that was within his legal power. Iran 's elite security forces are warning opposition supporters not to hold anti-government demonstrations during a government-sponsored rally on Friday. Opposition activists have called for protests coinciding with the Quds Day rallies , the annual event that expresses support for Palestinians and condemns Israel. Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi has said he plans to attend and activists have encouraged people to capitalize on the large gatherings to protest the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. On Thursday , Iranian state media published a message from the elite Revolutionary Guards promising to crack down on any protests during the rallies. Following Iran's disputed June 12 elections , rights groups said hundreds of people were detained in clashes with security forces during post-election , anti-government demonstrations. Since then , authorities have held public trials of the accused and tried to marginalize moderate officials within the government.

They left after a tense hour-long standoff with riot police. U.N. relief coordinator Jan Egeland said Sunday , U.S. , Indonesian and Australian military helicopters are ferrying out food and supplies to remote areas of western Aceh province that ground crews can not reach. Mr. Egeland said the latest figures show 1.8 million people are in need of food assistance - with the need greatest in Indonesia , Sri Lanka , the Maldives and India. He said last week 's tsunami and the massive underwater earthquake that triggered it has affected millions in Asia and Africa. Some 1,27,000 people are known dead.

Doctors describe the tiny hole as a minor birth defect and say it is in the partition between the upper chambers of Mr. Sharon 's heart. The procedure , known as cardiac catheterization , involves inserting a catheter through a blood vessel into the heart , where an umbrella-like device will plug the hole . Doctors say they expect Mr. Sharon will make a full recovery. Mr. Sharon returned to work on December 25 , one week after his emergency hospitalization. Doctors say the stroke has not caused any permanent damage. The designers of the first private manned rocket to burst into space have received a $ 10 million prize created to promote space tourism. SpaceShipOne designer Burt Rutan accepted the Ansari X Prize money and a trophy on behalf of his team Saturday during an awards ceremony in the U.S. state of Missouri . To win the money , SpaceShipOne had to blast off into space twice in a two-week period and fly at least 100 kilometers above Earth.
